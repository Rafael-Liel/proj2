      <li><strong>Which component did you find most flexible?</strong><br> I found the card component the most challenging because it’s very customizable and works great on all screen sizes.</li>
      <li><strong>What challenges did you face with layout or alignment?</strong><br> Getting content centered and spaced nicely using Bootstrap’s grid and utilities was difficult</li>
      <li><strong>If you could improve this with custom styles or JS, what would you add?</strong><br> if i were to add/change something using Styles, i would add box shadows, a better looking hover button in contact me, and maybe change the picture shape and add borders to it.</li>
